	<i>What's holding back good policy?</i> As researchers, we want to know how to improve state policy and pass important legislation. To do so, we're asking for your help in understanding and solving the toughest policy bottlenecks facing state governments across the United States.</p>

	<p>
		To help, please complete our 8 minute survey on state policy. In exchange, we'll provide you with a thank-you gift, ranging from a $5 gift card to prizes worth $25. Also, we'll email you a custom report on what voters in <b>your</b> district think about state policy. </p>
